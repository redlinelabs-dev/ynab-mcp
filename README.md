# @redlinelabs/ynab-mcp

MCP server for [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) (You Need A Budget). Gives AI assistants (Claude
Desktop, Claude Code, etc.) tools to browse budgets, accounts, categories, transactions, and
months, and to make targeted edits (set a category's budgeted amount, create/update transactions).

> All monetary amounts in YNAB are **milliunits** — `1000` = one currency unit. Read tools return
> both the raw milliunit value and a human-friendly `*_units` sibling; write tools take milliunits.

> **Bank linking is not possible via the YNAB API** — it's a YNAB web/app-only feature. This server
> creates only _manual_ accounts; once you've linked a bank in the app, `import_transactions` can
> pull its latest activity. The API rate limit is **200 requests/hour** per token.

## Tools

Tools are organized into **toolsets** (groups) you can enable/disable — see
[Toolsets](#toolsets). `✏️` marks mutating (write) tools, which can be disabled all at once with
`YNAB_READ_ONLY`.

## Self-hosting the remote server (Docker)

The **primary** way to run this: a remote, multi-tenant OAuth server you host yourself. Anyone who
can reach it logs in with **their own** YNAB account (browser OAuth) and gets their own isolated,
read-only-by-default data — connect once and it stays connected (YNAB refresh tokens don't expire).
Reach it over Tailscale or your LAN. Full reference: **[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)**.

OAuth needs HTTPS, so the server sits behind a stable HTTPS front. The bundled `docker-compose.yml`
runs the **prebuilt GHCR image** (`ghcr.io/redlinelabs-dev/ynab-mcp`) behind a **Tailscale sidecar**
that terminates HTTPS and serves it at `https://${TS_HOSTNAME}` — no reverse proxy, no clone. Give the
app its own directory holding just `docker-compose.yml` + `.env`:

```bash
mkdir ynab-mcp && cd ynab-mcp
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redlinelabs-dev/ynab-mcp/main/docker-compose.yml

# YNAB OAuth app: Account Settings > Developer Settings > New OAuth Application,
# redirect URI = https://<TS_HOSTNAME>/callback   (e.g. https://ynab.your-tailnet.ts.net/callback)

cat > .env <<'ENV'
TS_HOSTNAME=ynab.your-tailnet.ts.net
TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-xxxxxxxxxxxx
YNAB_CLIENT_ID=your-ynab-oauth-client-id
YNAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-ynab-oauth-client-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=base64-of-32-random-bytes      # openssl rand -base64 32
DATA_DIR=/mnt/HomeServer/Apps/ynab-mcp
ENV

docker compose up -d
curl -s https://${TS_HOSTNAME}/health         # {"status":"ok"}
```

GHCR packages are **private by default** (you'll get `unauthorized` on pull). Easiest fix: make the
package public — Org → Packages → `ynab-mcp` → Package settings → **Change visibility → Public** (safe;
the image has no secrets). Or keep it private and `sudo docker login ghcr.io -u <user>` on the host
first. Details + exact URL in [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md). Pin a version tag —
`image: ghcr.io/redlinelabs-dev/ynab-mcp:v0.1.0` — for reproducible deploys.
Prefer to build instead of pull, or use a reverse proxy instead of Tailscale? Both are in
[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) (comments in `docker-compose.yml` cover the build option).

### Connect a client to your deployed server

Once it's up at `https://${TS_HOSTNAME}`, point any MCP client that supports **remote servers with
OAuth** at `https://${TS_HOSTNAME}/mcp`. There's nothing to configure beyond the URL — the server
supports dynamic client registration, so the client registers itself and you log in through the
browser (YNAB), choosing read-only or write on the consent screen. The connection then persists.

> The client machine must be able to reach `${TS_HOSTNAME}` — for a Tailscale deploy that means it's
> signed into the same tailnet. HTTPS is required (the deploy provides it).

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ynab https://ynab.your-tailnet.ts.net/mcp
#   add  -s user  to make it available in every project (default: current project)
```

Then, in a session, run `/mcp` → **Authenticate** to do the browser OAuth login. Re-run `/mcp`
anytime to check status or re-authenticate.

**Claude Desktop**

Settings → **Connectors** → **Add custom connector**, name it `YNAB`, and enter the URL
`https://ynab.your-tailnet.ts.net/mcp`. Claude Desktop walks you through the OAuth login and the YNAB
tools appear once connected. (Needs a Claude Desktop version with custom-connector / remote-MCP
support.)

**Other clients** (Cursor, VS Code, hermes-agent, …)

Anything that speaks **remote / Streamable HTTP MCP** connects the same way — give it the URL and
complete the browser prompt. For clients configured by JSON, it's usually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ynab": { "type": "http", "url": "https://ynab.your-tailnet.ts.net/mcp" }
  }
}
```

**Headless clients without a browser** (e.g. an agent in a container) can skip OAuth entirely if you
set `YNAB_PAT_PASSTHROUGH=true` on the server: then `/mcp` also accepts a **YNAB Personal Access
Token** sent as a static bearer header — no flow, no expiry. In hermes that's just:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  ynab:
    url: "https://ynab.your-tailnet.ts.net/mcp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer <your-YNAB-PAT>"
```

OAuth keeps working alongside it; the PAT path is per-request (each client uses its own token). Add
`YNAB_READ_ONLY=true` on the server to gate the PAT path to read-only.

## Setup (local stdio server)

This runs the server locally over stdio with a Personal Access Token — for single-user/dev use, or
clients that launch the process directly. (The remote Docker server above is the multi-user path.)

### 1. Create a YNAB Personal Access Token

In YNAB, go to **Account Settings → Developer Settings → New Token**.

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file (or pass env vars directly):

```env
YNAB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
YNAB_BUDGET_ID=last-used
```

- `YNAB_TOKEN` — your Personal Access Token (**required**)
- `YNAB_BUDGET_ID` — default budget for tools that omit `budget_id`. Accepts a budget UUID or an
  alias (`last-used`, `default`). Defaults to `last-used`.
- `YNAB_TOOLSETS` — optional comma-separated [toolsets](#toolsets) to expose (default: all)
- `YNAB_READ_ONLY` — optional; set to `true` to expose only read tools

> **Two ways to run this.** The instructions below are the **local, single-user stdio** server (a
> Personal Access Token on your own machine). For a **remote, multi-user OAuth** server you self-host
> (Docker on your homelab, reachable over Tailscale/LAN, each person logging in with their own YNAB
> account), see **[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)** — that is the primary deployment. This package is
> not published to npm; build it locally first with `npm install && npm run build`.

### 3. Add to Claude Code

After `npm run build`, point the client at the built stdio entry (`dist/index.js`):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  --env YNAB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token \
  --env YNAB_BUDGET_ID=last-used \
  ynab -- node /absolute/path/to/ynab-mcp/dist/index.js
```

Env vars are scoped to the server process — no global environment setup needed.

### 4. Add to Claude Desktop

Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) or
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ynab": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/ynab-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YNAB_TOKEN": "your-personal-access-token",
        "YNAB_BUDGET_ID": "last-used"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Toolsets

To avoid bloating the model's context window, you can expose only the tool groups you need. Two
independent controls:

- **`YNAB_TOOLSETS`** — comma-separated group names, or `all` (default). Groups: `budgets`,
  `accounts`, `categories`, `transactions`, `months`, `payees`, `scheduled`.
- **`YNAB_READ_ONLY`** — `true`/`1` exposes only non-mutating tools (drops every `✏️` tool).

```env
# Only read budgets, accounts, and transactions — never write:
YNAB_TOOLSETS=budgets,accounts,transactions
YNAB_READ_ONLY=true
```

Disabled tools are hidden from `tools/list` and rejected if called directly.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # watch mode
npm test           # run the Vitest suite
npm run check      # typecheck + lint + format check + tests
npm run build      # production build
```

Tests are unit/integration style against the public module interfaces, using an injected fake
`fetch` — they never touch the live YNAB API or the rate limit.

## Versioning
